## Local development with VS Code and Docker

This project is ready to use the extension [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
This means that is you've that extension and Docker installed, you can run your **VS Code** inside a container with this code and use all its capabilities (*linting*, *debugging*, *run scritps*, etc).

Just install the extensions, open this directory and it will ask you if you want to open it inside the container. Say yes and start coding.
See more info here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers
